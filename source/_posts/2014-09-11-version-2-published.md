The International Image Interoperability Framework community ([http://iiif.io/][home-page]) is pleased to announce the release of the second major version of its specifications intended to provide a shared layer for dynamic interactions with images and the structure of the collections and objects of which they are part.  These APIs are used in production systems to enable cross-institutional integration of content, via mix and match of best of class front end applications and servers.

This release adds additional functionality derived from real world use cases needed by partners within the community, and reflects more than a year of experience with the previous versions and significant input from across the cultural heritage community.  It also formalizes many of the aspects that were implicit in the initial versions and makes puts into place a manageable framework for sustainable future development.  Detailed change notes are available.

The specifications are available at:

  * Image API: [http://iiif.io/api/image/2.0/][image-api]
  * Presentation API: [http://iiif.io/api/presentation/2.0/][prezi-api]

Accompanying the release of the specifications is a suite of community infrastructure tools, including reference implementations of all versions of the Image API, collections of valid and intentionally invalid example Presentation API resource descriptions, plus validators for both APIs.  Production ready software is available for the full Image API stack, with server implementations in both [Loris][loris] and [IIP Server][iipserver], and rich client support in the popular [Open Seadragon][osd].  

There will be a rollout and dissemination event on October 20th, 2014 at the British Library to celebrate this release and engage with the wider community.  Further details are [available][london], registration is required and all are welcome.

Feedback, comments and questions are welcomed on the [discussion list][iiif-discuss].

Sincerely and on behalf of the community,
